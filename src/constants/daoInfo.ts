    q: "How can you verify provider credentials?",
    a: "All members of the community must go through a KYC/Proof of Humanity check.  Additionally, subDAOs may have additional credentialing requirements.  Providers will be credentialed using a 3rd party provider, once the provider has been approved a non-transferrable NFT will be minted to their wallet enabling their entry into the proper subDAO.
